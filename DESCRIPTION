Description: The package implements multi-penalty linear, logistic and cox ridge regression, including estimation of the penalty parameters by efficient (repeated) cross-validation or maximum marginal likelihood. It allows for multiple high-dimensional data types that require penalization, as well as unpenalized variables. Moreover, it allows a paired penalty for paired data types, and preferential data types can be specified.
